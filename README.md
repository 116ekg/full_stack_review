# Welcome to Blockbuster!

In this fullstack review application, you will be bringing Blockbuster back from the dead. You will be setting up a server and a database, creating a RESTful API for their inventory, and rendering views on the front end to see the data. 

## Tech Stack
Express
MySQL
Sequelize
React / Angular

## Task
Go through the file structure and fill in the "TODO"s throughout the application

## To Do List:

**Try to build the app without looking at this todo list, but if you're feeling lost at what direction to go, go ahead and look at this list to guide you**

1. Set up a server and get it to serve up a static file (depending on your front end framework of choice, make sure it's pointing to the right folder)
2. Set up a database; the solution code will use Sequelize but feel free to choose whichever ORM you wish.
3. Write routes and controllers for your server to interact with your database. Use Postman to test your routes
4. Render front end components to utilize your routes. At minimum, you want to:
* Post a movie to the database
* Get all movies to the database
4b. Make it so that the page renders one or the other, but not both
5. Style!

## Extra
This review only covers barebones concepts. If you'd like, feel free to build on top of it (adding put and delete routes, creating more tables with relations, adding more front end components, etc).
